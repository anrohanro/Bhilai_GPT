  Professional core courses: A department may specify discipline-wise a set of courses for each programs that every student of specific discipline in the program must register for and must clear. 
  Departmental elective courses: A bouquet of courses offered by the department out of which the students must choose to register in order to fulfil the requirements of the discipline in the program and must clear. Department may also declare some specific courses offered by other departments a-priori as departmental elective courses. Departments shall specify the total number of credits that should be cleared with departmental elective courses. 
  Open elective courses: A bouquet of courses offered by various departments of the institute which the students must choose to register from his/her own department or from any other department and clear. A department will allocate zero or more slots for open electives in each program discipline-wise. Open electives are meant to widen the knowledge beyond the parent discipline and broaden the horizon by exposing the problems/areas in other disciplines. Departments shall specify the credits that should be cleared with open elective courses. 
  Creative Art and Liberal Art courses: The Institute believes in a well-rounded development of its students. To that extent, Institute specifies program-wise credits to be earned by students amongst a bouquet of courses in Creative Arts and Liberal Arts. 
  A student shall not be permitted to do a course more than once and use their credits towards the fulfilment of the requirements of the program. 
  Those students desirous to earn extra knowledge of subjects can be permitted by the course instructor to audit the course. Such courses shall not count towards the credit requirements and shall not be reflected in the grade sheet. 
Course Numbering System 
Each course is referred to by a course code and title. 
Course code for each course is a five alpha-numeric characters comprising of two alphabets followed by three numerals. An example numbering is shown below. 

 
The alphabetical part of the course code represents the department offering the course while the numerical part of the course code provides level of the course, nature of the course and a unique identification of the course. 
17. Grading and Performance Evaluation 
Grading System

Grades for Thesis and Candidacy Examination 

Grades for Audited Courses and Essential Physical Activity 

The course/activity is said to be cleared if the student receives a grade other than FS, F and I. 
All students shall appear in all examinations (including the mid-semester and end-semester examinations). Failure to appear in any examination will cause 0 (zero) marks to be awarded in that examination and the grading to be carried out accordingly. A student who fails to appear in any written examination (mid-semester or end-semester examination) due to genuine medical or unavoidable reasons may be permitted by the course instructor to take make-up examination subject to certification by the Institute doctor on the severity of the medical condition. The student should make a request for this purpose supported by all documents. Such a request shall reach the course instructor within two days of last date of mid-semester examination or end-semester examination (whichever exam is missed by the student). In exceptional circumstances, course instructors may also allow students to appear in the makeup examination to provide them with an additional chance to improve their performance. Students who are permitted to appear in the make-up examination shall be awarded FS grade. If the student fails to appear in the make-up examination as per the academic calendar, the FS grade is converted to regular grade. The make-up examination shall be used to substitute the marks of the examination missed by the student and the grading shall be carried out by the instructor as per the regular class grading. 
F grade is given by the instructor when he/she is convinced that the student must repeat the course, including all lectures, labs, examinations etc. The student must repeat the course if it is a core or a professional core course. For other courses, the student can replace the course with another course of the same category. 
I grade is given by the instructor when the student fails to complete the course and will require some extra time to finish the project work or assignment. I grade must be converted to a regular grade within one week of the end of the semester (last day of the last tierce examination). An unconverted I grade is automatically converted to F grade. 
Students shall be awarded 'S' or 'F' grades in the audited courses and the same shall be reflected in the grade card or transcript of the student. However, grades of the audited courses shall not be considered in the SGPA/CGPA calculation. 
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) 
The SGPA is a weighted sum of the associated numeric points earned by the student for each course registered in a particular semester with weights being the credit of the course. CGPA is the weighted sum of all courses in the program. The academic performance of a student is typically indicated by SGPA and CGPA. 
For example, if the courses and corresponding credits registered for by a student in a semester and the numeric points obtained (corresponding to the grades) are as per the given table, the SGPA shall be computed as per the given formula. 

CGPA is computed in the similar way except that the courses are taken across all semesters. While computing SGPA and CGPA, the rules of repetition of courses are followed. 
The institute award CGPA on a scale of 10 (Ten) after the assessment of the students. The institute does not offer any formula for the conversion of CGPA to percentage or any other scale. However, wherever percentage is the norm, the CGPA of all IIT Bhilai graduates be notionally converted into percentage by multiplying the CGPA by a factor of 10 (Ten). For the purpose of employment or requirement of any external body, IIT Bhilai graduate having 6 (Six) CGPA and above be taken as First Class. 
Evaluation System 
All courses shall run for the entire semester (approximately 14 weeks). IIT Bhilai supports continuous evaluation of performance of students in various courses. Course instructor of a course is responsible for conducting written examinations, surprised/announced quizzes, home assignments, project works, lab assignments, presentations, interviews, oral examinations or any other method of evaluation. The weightage for each of these components shall be announced by the course instructor a-priori. Among such examination methods, the formal written examinations (mid-semester and end-semester examinations) shall be carried out as per the academic calendar of the Institute. The course instructor may choose the method of evaluation depending upon the nature of the course and shall make it known to the class in the beginning. 
The academic calendar of the Institute shall reserve slots for mid-semester and end-semester examinations. The examinations shall be carried out only during this schedule. 
Repetition of a Course 
A student must repeat a course under the following conditions. 
  When he/she receives an F grade. 
  When the credits for the course expire after seven years of its validity. 
  When the student desires to repeat the course to improve the grade. 
When a course is repeated, all grades in the courses shall be reflected in the transcripts in the semester they are done (except FS and I which are transient grades and must be converted to other grades).  
When a course is repeated, the last grade obtained will be considered in the computations of the CGPA. The SGPA computations shall include all such courses in the corresponding semesters. 
The courses and the grades for the courses with the expired credits shall not be reflected in the final transcript. These shall not be included in the computation of CGPA after expiration. Such expired credits shall also not be considered cleared. 
A student will also have a choice to repeat any other course voluntarily in case he/she wishes to improve the grade in that course.  
Thesis Evaluation 
Students shall be required to register for thesis credits as per the academic program structure. They must choose their supervisor(s) as early as possible, preferably prior to pre-registration of the second semester. In each semester with prescribed thesis requirements, the student is required to register for thesis credits, which will be evaluated on the semester basis. The thesis grades shall be given by the DUGC/DPGC convener.

Students copying from each other or from any other sources (including Internet, books, monographs, research papers etc.) for their academic activities without giving proper reference to the original source falls under plagiarism. This defeats the purpose of doing academic activities which is to learn and grow academically and professionally. Performing academic activities by copying is counter-productive as students invest time and learn almost nothing. Plagiarism discourages hard work among students and faculty both. 
Policy 
At IIT Bhilai, plagiarism is strictly prohibited. A case of plagiarism will be dealt by DUGC/DPGC and could be referred to the institute wide disciplinary action committee; the committee, depending upon the severity of the case may give FS/F in the course, suspend the student for a certain period or may expel the student from the institute. A faculty has the right to check the students' submission at any time and take necessary action. It is the responsibility of students to ensure originality of their work, be aware of this policy and abide by it.
