Scope :
The provisions of this course of study are applicable to all programs and disciplines. The academic senate may change any or all parts of this course of study at any time. 

Introduction :
IIT Bhilai offers a semester-oriented undergraduate, postgraduate and research programs with an objective of imparting best quality science and engineering education. Admissions to the academic programs are synchronized with an academic year, though in some cases, it may be synchronized to the start of a semester. 
An academic year starts in the month of July each calendar year and ends in the month of June of the next calendar year. Each academic year is divided into three semesters - Monsoon, Winter and Summer semesters. The Monsoon and Winter semesters are two regular semesters while the Summer semester is a shorter semester. 
IIT Bhilai is currently offering Bachelors of Technology (BTech), Master of Science (MSc), Masters of Technology (MTech) and Doctorate (PhD) programs in various departments/ disciplines. This document provides the curricula of all programs at IIT Bhilai along with the list of courses as on date. 
 	 

Part A: Curriculum 
Types of Courses 
The course classification at IIT Bhilai is specific to the program and is categorized under five broad categories. 
1. Core courses (IC): A set of courses that every student of a program at IIT Bhilai must register for and must clear. 
2. Professional core courses (PC): For a program, the department may specify a set of courses discipline wise that every student of the specific discipline must register for and must clear. 
3. Departmental elective courses (DE): A bouquet of courses declared by the department out of which students must register for and must clear program-wise specified minimum number of credits to fulfil the graduation requirements of the program.  
4. Open elective courses (OE): A bouquet of courses offered by various departments of the institute, out of which the students must choose to register for and must clear a number of courses to meet the minimum specified OE credit requirements for a program. Open electives courses are meant to widen the knowledge beyond the parent discipline and broaden the horizon by exposing the problems/areas in other disciplines. 
5. Create Art and Liberal Art courses (CA/LA): The Institute believes in a well-rounded development of its students. To that extent, Institute specifies a minimum number of program-wise credits to be earned by students amongst a bouquet of courses in Creative Arts and Liberal Arts. 


Course pre-requisites :
All the academic programs offered at IIT Bhilai follows a credit-based course structure, in which students shall register for courses of their interest, falling under various categories as defined above, based on their program credit requirement and suggested curriculum structure. While doing so, it is essential that the students meet all the pre-requisites of the course which the student intend to register for.  
Pre-requisites of a course (i.e. dependent course) are those courses (i.e. precedent courses) which must be cleared (in some cases concurrent registration is also permitted) prior to registering for the course.  
If the dependent course is an IC/PC for a program, taken as an elective (E.g. by students of other department as open elective), instructor's consent is to be taken prior to registration. Instructor's consent is not necessary if the pre-requisites are satisfied for the course being taken as elective.  


Bachelor of Technology (BTech) :
IIT Bhilai currently offers BTech program in five disciplines. 
1. Computer Science and Engineering, 
2. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, 
3. Electrical Engineering,  
4. Mechanical Engineering, and 
5. Mechatronics. 
General structure of BTech program 
BTech program at IIT Bhilai is a fully residential program with a nominal duration of 4 years.  
Accordingly, the minimum credit requirements for students in various categories of courses to become eligible for the award of BTech Degree from IIT Bhilai is as follows. 
S. No.         Category            Minimum Credits

Bachelor of Technology with Honours (BTech (Honours)) 
General structure of BTech (Honours) program 
Students completing two years of BTech program in IIT Bhilai can opt for conversion to BTech (Honours) subject to the conditions and procedures prescribed by the Senate. IIT Bhilai offers BTech (Honours) program in two different modes. 
1. Through additional courses in a discipline (called as specialization) other than the one, student has registered for his BTech program. 
2. Through thesis in the discipline, the student has registered for his BTech program.  
The structure of BTech (Honours) program upto 4th Semester remains same as that of BTech program. From 5th Semester onwards, in addition to the courses mentioned in the BTech program structure, BTech (Honours) students have to register for additional six credits per semester towards discipline-specific courses/thesis based on the mode of their BTech (Honours) program. 
BTech (Honours) through thesis 
i. Students admitted to thesis-based BTech (Honours) must earn a minimum of 18 credits through thesis. Thesis credits are earned by registering for thesis course.  
ii. Students would register for additional courses from 5th semester of their BTech program with the nominal load of 36 credits to fulfill the credit requirements of BTech (Honours) program. 
iii. Students shall register for thesis credits from their 6th semester onwards. Students should register for thesis credits for a minimum of 2 semesters. 
iv. Students can make use of the summer semester between the 5th and 6th semester for executing the research work by registering for thesis not exceeding 12 credits during the summer semester. 
v. Thesis credits will be evaluated and graded in units of 6 credits (i.e.) there will be a grade associated with every 6 thesis credits (or part thereof) registered for.  
vi. Students should do the research work towards a minimum thesis credit requirement of 18. The remaining credit requirements for BTech (Honours) should be earned by registering for courses within/across the department(s). 
vii. Upon recommendation of the supervisor, the DUGC convener may permit the students to register for more than 18 thesis credits.
